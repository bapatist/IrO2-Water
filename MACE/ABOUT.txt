When using evaluate_config on the GPU model (the default .model file), use flags --batch_size=10 (same as training) and also use flag --device=cuda
For CPU model, convert it to CPU model by running "model_to_cpu" script. no need for flags just ensure that you provide the file name of the CPU model in --model
